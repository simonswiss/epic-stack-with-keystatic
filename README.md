# Epic Stack with Keystatic

This example adds a simple blog to the Epic Stack with
[Keystatic](https://keystatic.com) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).

The blog is available at the `/blog` route. Posts can be edited via the MDX
files directly, or via the Keystatic Admin UI available at the `/keystatic`
route.

Content schemas are defined and configured in the `keystatic.config.tsx` file.
